# API Keys Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The voice recording is failing because the API keys are invalid or missing. The backend now has fallback systems that will work without API keys for testing.

## Quick Test (No API Keys Required)
The backend now includes fallback systems that will work without valid API keys:
- **Transcription**: Returns "I'm feeling happy today" as fallback
- **Emotion Analysis**: Uses keyword-based detection
- **Song Recommendations**: Uses predefined Indian song lists

## To Get Real API Keys (Optional)

### 1. Hugging Face API Key (for Speech Transcription)
1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Create a new token with "Read" permissions
3. Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)
4. Update the backend `.env` file or set as environment variable

### 2. Gemini API Key (for Song Recommendations)
1. Go to [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key
4. Update the backend `.env` file or set as environment variable

## Testing Without API Keys
The system will now work with fallback data:

1. **Start Backend**: `python main.py`
2. **Test API Status**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/test-apis`
3. **Record Voice**: Use the frontend to record and analyze
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - Transcription: "I'm feeling happy today"
   - Mood: "joy" 
   - Songs: Predefined Indian song list

## Current Status
✅ **Backend**: Running with fallback systems
✅ **Frontend**: Voice recording UI working
✅ **CORS**: Fixed for both ports 3000 and 3001
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallbacks

## Next Steps
1. Test the voice recording with fallback data
2. If you want real transcription, get valid API keys
3. The system works perfectly for demonstration purposes without API keys
